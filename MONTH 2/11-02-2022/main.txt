>> Everything inside an ES6 module is private by default, and runs in strict mode (thereâ€™s no need for 'use strict').
>> Public variables, functions and classes are exposed using export.
>> Exposed modules are called into other modules using import
>> Modules must be included in your HTML with type="module", which can be an inline or external script tag.
