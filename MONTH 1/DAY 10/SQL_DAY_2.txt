CONSTRAINTS
-----------
1) primary key
==>What's primary key in database?
---->A primary key is the column or columns that contain values that uniquely identify each row in a table. A database table 
---->must have a primary key for Optim to 
---->insert, update, restore, or delete data from a database table. Optim uses primary keys that are defined to the database.

2)froeign key
==>parent table(refrenced table) ==> primary key
                     ||
                     --
                     foreign key (child table )(refrencing table)
==>name of the key are different but the data of the key are same and same data type
==>ON DELETE CASCADE is delete the data in parent also child table delete this rows data
==>for data reduction no developer use on delete CASCADE in database
==>we also add foreign key after create a table

ex.
    ALTER TABLE sales 
    ADD foreign key(col1) refrences parent_table_name(col1) on delete CASCADE;

3) unique key
==> all value of colums it been unique (ex. email address)
==> ex. alter table table_name add unique key (col_name);

4)indexes
==> for retriving data more easily
==> use unique key more preferebale for creating an index 

5) default
==> defualt value for every column
==>
ex. alter table table_name
    change colums number_of_complaint number_of_complaint int defualt 0;

6) not null
==> for alter table command only null is available infront of not null
==>change column have not null on alter command


DDL (data define language)==> create , drop , alter , rename
DMl (data manipulation language)==> select , insert, update , delete 
DCL (data control langage) ==> grant , revoke
TCL (transition control language) => commit , rollback , savepoint  

Coding Techniques and besr practices
------------------------------------
==> always choes meaningfull and short name
==> pronounceable
==> capitalized sql keyword
==> /* ...... */ => for large comment
==> # and -- for short one line comments


WHERE vs HAVING

>> where use for row
>> having use for group of row
