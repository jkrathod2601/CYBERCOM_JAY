1) what is data structure? 
 -->A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, 
    processing, retrieving and storing data. There are
    several basic and advanced types of data structures,
    all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose.
    Data structures make it easy for users to access and
    work with the data they need in appropriate ways.

2) what is algorithm?
 -->An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a
    problem or accomplishing a task. One common example of
    an algorithm is a recipe, which consists of specific
    instructions for preparing a dish or meal.

 --> Take an example of the destination from home to school
     and how we find the solution of this problem with the data structure
     with use of graph and hash map data structure we solve this problem
 -->take an data structure example of the array and linklist and how both are
    important for task
 -->take an example of the party how we use which data structure is usefull when
 -->supppose we ehave add an person that time linklist is imoportant and finding any person 
   that time array is more usefull

   ARRAY
   _____
   -->various java array method 
   -->in java it's take an 32 bit=4 byte
   -->maximum value and minimum value-2147483648 to 2147483647 int
   -->character siz is 2 byte
   -->double and long 8 byte
   -->boolean 1 bit
   -->primitive data type:define by java:int,float,double,boolean
   -->non primitive data type:not definmed by java:array,string

   Class and Object
   ----------------
   -->basic class and object
   -->oop concept
      -->inheritance
      -->constructor
      -->abstract
      -->aggregation
      -->run time and compile time polymorphism
      -->interface
      -->incapstulation
