         => DECLARE v_variablename DECIMAL(10,2)
2) session => a series of information exchange interaction , or dialogue betwwen a computer and a user
        ==> when session is started

                created by a certain connection
            ==> SET global max_connections=100;
                SET @@global.max_connections=1;

USER DEFINE vs SYSTEM VARIABLE
===============================

user_define ==> variable that can be set by the user mannualy

system ==> variables that are pre-defined on our system the MYSQL server

=>user define only local variable
=> system variable is an global variable
=>> session variabale can be user define and also system variable

MYSQL indexes
===============

1) clusterd index
2) non clusterd index

syntax:::  create index index_name
            on table_1 (c_1,c_2);
composite indexes ==> crate multiple indexing

==> primary key and uniqe key are mysql index
 for getting indexing information
==> show index from table_1;

CASE statement
==============

syntax::

select 
        column_name 
        CASE condition_field
            when condition_field_1 then result_1
            when condition_field_2 then result_2
            when condition_field_3 then result_3

            ELSE result_else
        END AS
from 
 table_name;


==>

    select 
        c_1,
        c_2,
        if(c_3="M","MALE","FEMALE") as c_3
    from 
        table_name;

if ==> only one condition
case ==> multiple condition
