what is time complexity?

==>Time Complexity is a concept in computer science that deals 
    with the quantification of the amount of time taken by a 
    set of code or algorithm to process or run as a function
     of the amount of input. In other words, the time 
     complexity is how long a program takes to process 
     a given input

1) BIG O notation (WORST CASE)
 =>Big oh notation is used to describe asymptotic upper bound.
 =>three type
    1)Linear time  = > O(n)
    2)constant time  = > O(1)
    3)qudarative time  = > O(n^2)

2)Big Omega notation (Ω) (BEST CASE)
 =>Just like O notation provide an asymptotic upper bound, Ω notation provides asymptotic lower bound
 
3) Big Theta notation (Θ) (Average case)
