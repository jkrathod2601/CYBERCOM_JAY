what is SQL?
-->structure query langage for working with the data base

row ==> Record
column ==> field

entity ==> the smallest unit that contain meaning-full set of data

1)relational database(table)
2)non relational database(csv file)

==>both are the part of database designer
ER DIAGRAM(ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM)
Relational schema (claassname and rectangular design)

TYPE OF KEY
-----------

1)Primary Key
 ==>What's primary key in database?
---->A primary key is the column or columns that contain values that uniquely identify each row in a table. A database table 
---->must have a primary key for Optim to 
---->insert, update, restore, or delete data from a database table. Optim uses primary keys that are defined to the database.

2)Foreign Key
--->connct one table to onether table it's call foreign key and table have more than one foreign key and null or rep

---> ating also
=======
--->ating also


3) uniq key
---->a key that have null value but different value
---->like a primary key but number of uniqe key is more than one or only one
---.they have single column or more than combination of one column is called an unique key

child table ==> refrancing table
parent table ==> refrance table

ON DELETE CASCADE ==> if we remove a row from parents also from the child this same id row will be drop

1)CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] databse_name;(for creating a database)
2)USE database_name;(for using database)

DATA TYPE
---------
1)CHAR ==> size(5 Bytes) ==> Storage fixed ==> maximum size(255 ) ==> 50% faster then varchar
2)VARCHAR ==> size(5 Bytes) ==> Storage variable ==>maximum size (65535)
3)ENUM(enumarate) ==> ENUM('M','F') ==> decide which value will be insterted into the database is work with ENUM

NUMERIC DATA TYPE
-----------------
1)INTEGER (or) INT (if we want to use unsigned thn we define into the query)
  (signed and asigned is always a part of this integer ,by default is was signed)
  (if signed then the maximum index/2 in both plus and minus site)
  type
  ----
  1)TINYINT => 1 byte
  2)SMALLINT => 2 byte
  3)MEDIUMINT => 3 byte
  4)INT       => 4 byte
  5)BIGINT    => 8 byte
2)FIXED AND FLOATING
  EX.
    10.523 ==> precision (5) ==>scale (3)
    DECIMAL(5(p),3(s)) ==> FIXED POINT TYPE ==> DECIMAL(p,s) (and) NUMERIC(p,s)
    FLOAT(p,s)(4 byte)=>round up value will given back is error ==> floating point data type => FLOAT(s,p) and DOUBLE(s,p)(8 byte)
3)DATETIME(date+time) (and) TIMESTAMP (and) DATE(only date)
  TIMESTAMP ==> take an exact well define time from 1st jan 1970 ==> give answer in second ==>use for managing the time zone

3.1) BLOB (Binary Large Object)(data file with 1 and 0)(.img and other file)

>> INT(10) means you probably defined it as INT UNSIGNED . So, you can store numbers from 0 
up to 4294967295 (note that the maximum value has 10 digits, so MySQL automatically added the (10)
 in the column definition which (10) is just a format hint and nothing more.

=======

4)CREATE TABLE 
  ex>
	create table Sales(
	purchase_of_number INT NOT NULL primary key AUTO_INCREMENT,
	date_of_purchase date NOT null,
	customer_id int,
	item_code varchar(10) NOT NULL
	);
  ex>
	create table Sales(
	purchase_of_number INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	date_of_purchase date NOT null,
	customer_id int,
	item_code varchar(10) NOT NULL,
	primary key(purchase_of_number)
	);

5) select * from sales.Sales;  (direct use the database and then . table name and access the data)

6) DROP TABLE table_name; (for deletinf the all table and also the structure)
